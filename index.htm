<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%'>Having more than 10 years of experience in genomics, Dr
Vibhor is working towards translational futuristic applications of genomics as
well as reducing cost for different application of genomics. He has published few
fundamental findings related to epigenome as well as developed computational
tools to analyse genomic profiles. He is applying his experience to study the
pattern in cell free DNA fragment and epigenome profile to develop sensitive
method to detect source non-hematopoietic cell.  With grant from department of
biotechnology and collaboration with AIIMs and CSIR-IGIB, he is generating
profile of cell free DNA from cancer patients. Given the fact that cell-free
DNA in blood plasma has potential to provide information about possible
disorder in body, it becomes an obvious choice to explore further. Dr Vibhor is
investigating all aspect of pattern in cell free DNA which include epigenome,
copy number variation and DNA fragmentation pattern.  He is currently
validating some of the markers discovered through computational analysis to
reduce the cost for more accurate detection of diseases. Given the fact that
Delhi is among regions with highest incidence of cancer in India (The Lancet
Oncology, volume 19,2018), it becomes our primary duty to develop non-destructive
diagnosis method for early detection of cancer. Early detection of cancer helps
in better cure for cancer. Dr Vibhor has the knowledge and access to facilities
which can help in extracting DNA from blood plasma to develop method to detect
methods for early cancer detection using cell free DNA. Initial collection of
blood plasma from Delhi clinics with phenotypic information followed by
profiling of DNA methylation and fragmentation pattern by companies, would help
in discovering markers through computational analysis.  The markers would help
in reducing the cost of early detection of cancer through targeted
DNA-sequencing.  Thus, with an initial investment we would build databases of
markers which could be further validated in patients with known symptoms. The
knowledge of set of markers and computational tools developed, can be
transferred to local Delhi hospitals for regular use.    </span></p>
